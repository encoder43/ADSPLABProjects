# ADSP Lab Final Project – Advanced Digital Signal Processing

## Introduction

The Advanced Digital Signal Processing (ADSP) Lab at NIT Rourkela as a part of its lab evaluation ,Prepared a set of practical problem statements for final projects. These projects are designed to help students apply their learning in signal processing, estimation, and vision-based systems to real-world scenarios.

In these projects, students will work on problems that combine classical signal processing techniques (like Kalman filtering for state estimation and tracking) with modern computer vision methods. The goal is to build systems that can process visual information, track objects, and make decisions in practical applications.

## Objective

The primary objective is to foster analytical thinking and problem-solving in real-world scenarios by applying signal processing and computer vision techniques to practical problems.

## Expected Work

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem statement carefully, understand the background and requirements
2. **Propose a Method**: Design an approach to solve the problem, considering available techniques and tools
3. **Implement a Solution**: Build a working prototype or simulation that demonstrates the approach
4. **Evaluate Results**: Test the solution on provided or publicly available datasets, measure performance using appropriate metrics
5. **Document Work**: Write clear documentation explaining the approach, implementation, results, and conclusions

## Deliverables

- **Code**: Working implementation with clear comments and structure (GitHub link will be shared via Google Form)
- **Report**: Written report (10-15 pages) describing problem understanding, methodology, implementation, results, and conclusions
- **Results**: Visual outputs, performance metrics, and demonstration videos (if applicable)
- **Presentation**: Brief presentation (10-15 minutes) explaining the work

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Understanding**: How well the student understands the problem and related concepts
- **Methodology**: Quality and appropriateness of the proposed approach
- **Implementation**: Correctness and completeness of the code
- **Results**: Quality of results and proper evaluation
- **Documentation**: Clarity and completeness of the report and project explanation

**Note:** It is not required or expected that you complete all aspects of the project. Evaluation is done based on how much percentage of the criteria is fulfilled. Focus on demonstrating understanding and implementing a working solution for the core aspects of your assigned problem.

## Timeline

- **Project Submission**: 25th November to 3rd December

## Technical Requirements

### Tools and Libraries

Students can use any programming language, but Python is recommended. Common libraries include:

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, scikit-image
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow (if needed)
- **Signal Processing**: NumPy, SciPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly

### Datasets

Each project description includes suggested datasets. Students can use publicly available datasets.

### Computing Resources

Projects can be completed using standard laptops/desktops, cloud computing resources (Google Colab, Kaggle, etc.), or lab computers (with permission).



## Getting Started

1. **Check Your Assignment**: Find your roll number in the Project Assignment section above to identify your assigned project and team members
2. **Read Your Project Description**: Read the detailed problem statement for your assigned project (Track_01 through Track_08 files)
3. **Coordinate with Your Team**: Contact your team members and establish communication channels for collaboration Discord is preferred sitting together in the lab and working is also encouraged as it is not mandatory it is your choice.
4. **Review Background Material**: Study relevant background material, algorithms, and suggested datasets for your project
5. **Plan Your Approach**: Discuss with your team and propose a methodology to solve the problem
6. **Start Implementation**: Begin with a simple baseline approach and iteratively improve your solution
7. **Set Up Repository**: Prepare your GitHub repository for code submission (link will be shared via Google Form)

## Important Notes

- Projects can be original work or any work inspiread from the research articles. You can use existing algorithms and libraries, but you must understand and explain what you're using
- Proper citations are required for any methods, datasets, or code you use from other sources
- Collaboration within teams is encouraged, but each team's work should be independent
- If you face technical difficulties, reach out early rather than waiting until the deadline

**Supervision:** All projects are evaluated by Dr. Upendra Kumar Sahoo and coordinated by TA Kannuru Srinadh, Yerram Deekshith Kumar, and Debapriya Das Gupta, ADSP Lab, NIT Rourkela.
